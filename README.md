### 👋 Hi, I’m Nneoma Uche. Most folk just call me Uche.

I'm a backend developer focused on building scalable APIs and server-side systems. 
I work primarily with Python, designing clean architectures that power 
reliable, production-ready applications. I also build lightweight UIs using HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate and validate the functionality of the systems 
I build on the backend. 

I enjoy integrating AI and machine learning capabilities into backend systems — 
from LLM-powered features to intelligent automation pipelines.

**What I work with:**
- Backend: Python, Django, FastAPI
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- AI/ML: OpenAI API, Gemini, LangChain, vector databases
- Tools: Docker, REST APIs, Git

I also write technical content for developer tools and agencies, breaking down 
complex concepts into clear, actionable guides for developer audiences.
